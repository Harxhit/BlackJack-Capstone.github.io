# BlackJack-Capstone üÉè

"Developed a Python-based Blackjack game as a personal project to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming and game development principles."

Key Skills: List the key skills demonstrated through the project:

Proficient in Python programming language
Strong understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
Familiarity with game development principles and logic
Project Details: Provide specific details about the Blackjack game project:

Created a text-based Blackjack game using Python, implementing core game mechanics such as card dealing, player decisions (hit or stand), and dealer AI logic.
Designed classes for Card, Deck, and Hand to manage game components efficiently.
Implemented game rules, including calculating hand values, managing player bets, and determining win conditions.
Utilized loops and conditional statements to create a user-friendly interface for player interaction.
Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Developed algorithms to handle game logic, ensuring accurate gameplay flow.
Employed data structures like lists and dictionaries to manage card decks and player hands dynamically.
Implemented error handling to manage user inputs and edge cases effectively.
### Rules
Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos and casual settings alike. Here are the basic rules:

Objective: The goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

Card Values:

Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more without exceeding 21.
Gameplay:

The game begins with each player (including the dealer) receiving two cards. Players' cards are usually dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up (known as the "upcard") and one face down (the "hole card").
Players take turns to decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
Players can also choose to "double down" (double their bet and receive only one additional card) or "split" (if dealt two cards of the same rank, split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet).
Winning and Losing:

If a player's hand total exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet.
If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand at the end of the round, they win and are paid even money on their bet.
If the player and dealer have the same total (called a push), the player keeps their bet but does not win additional money.
Dealer's Turn:

After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card.
The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher. This rule varies in some variants of the game.
Blackjack:

If a player or the dealer is dealt an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, King) as their initial two cards, they have Blackjack. A Blackjack typically pays 3:2 (1.5 times the bet), unless the dealer also has Blackjack, resulting in a push.
Variants:

There are many variations of Blackjack with slight rule differences, such as the number of decks used, whether the dealer hits on soft 17 (Ace and 6), and specific payout rules.
